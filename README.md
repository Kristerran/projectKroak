## Description
- Virtuefig is my first personal project started during school. Originally called "Project Kroak" (After my first DND Character) Virtuefig is a visual character creator for DND or other table top games. I created Virtuefig to experiment with the technologies we had utilized so far.

### Project Motivation:
- My initial plan (And plan moving forward) is for virtuefig to be an avatar generator. Users will submit their stats from a character sheet and recieve a custom virtual miniature figure. I saw this as a suplement for physical figurines in for use in a virtual campaign (All the more common in this day and age.) I was motivated to create something fun to challenge myself further to create something truly unique and my own during class to showcase my creativity with my newfound technical skills.

### Project Problem solved:
- This project will make visual character creation simple and easy for those that do not have the skills or need to draw. It will eventually make showing physical features of your character easier to showcase with minimal effort.

### Skills Learned during project:
- Solidified knowledge of MVC Structure, I had a chance to learn bootstrap making templating a breeze, as well as some custom css for image layering.

## Installation
This project can be viewed at https://www.virtuefig.com. To install locally, clone down the repo and run an npm Install command. The development server can then be activated with the included npm run start script.

## Usage
- This project can be used to make simple avatars for dnd use. Simply select your characters race, class, and background (Not yet implemented, placeholder: choose a background you like!) and see the avatar to the right update in real time. Users can sign up for an account where in future development they can save their creations and download for personal use.

## Tests
Try out our application, Test out the different options for races and classes, check that all pages and content render properly.
